LeapNoise
=======

A simple LeapMotion app for controlling iTunes via AppleScript, built using the
[BlueGel](http://github.com/arsduo/bluegel.js) framework.

Usage:

Start with `npm start` (after `npm install`, of course). 

* To enable gesture control, hold you hand in place over the sensor for a second. 
* To move tracks, swipe forward and backward.
* To change the volume, swipe upward and downward.
* To play/pause, swipe away from your body (quickly, like you're poking
someone).
